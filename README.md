# Bolt.Addons.Community
A community-driven project for extending Unity Bolt with custom nodes, types, and helpers.

Development is open to the community.


#### Why Bolt.Addons.Community and not Bolt.Community.Addons?  
While the latter flows off of the tongue more naturally, this project aims to be part of a larger ecosystem of addons and so aims for the former.  If auto-adding custom types from namespaces becomes a supported  feature of Bolt, Bolt.Addons.X is preferable.

## How to build
add the following dlls from your Unity Project with Bolt installed:

\Dependencies\BoltBinaries
 - Bolt.Core.Runtime.dll
 - Bolt.Flow.Runtime.dll
 - Bolt.State.Runtime.dll
 - Ludiq.Core.Runtime.dll
 - Ludiq.Graphs.Runtime.dll
  
\Dependencies\UnityBinaries
 - UnityEditor.dll
 - UnityEngine.CoreModule.dll
 - UnityEngine.dll
 - UnityEngine.UI.dll

Open and build the \src\Bolt.Addons.Community.sln solution in Visual Studio 2017.
