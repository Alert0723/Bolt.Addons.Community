@Reality.Stop() Here goes for the type of events:

- Global Event: Is triggered to the event bus (EventBus.Trigger) on all handlers.
- Game Object Event: Is triggered through the event bus (EventBus.Trigger), but only on handlers where the EventHook's target matches. (Basically: "local" events)
- Manual Event: Will have to get triggered through TriggerEventHandler. Usually used for special cases & edit mode stuff like gizmos.
- Event (abstract): None of this is very well defined, so you can derive it to implement really customized events.

It's important to note that the event bus does not exist during edit mode, so if you need to run graph code then, you'll probably need Manual Event.
